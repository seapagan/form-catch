# TODO

- add logging to file for any errors
- check if the supplied email address is valid on site creation, fail if not
- add User Authentication and Authorization, users should not be able to mess
  with or even list any other users sites. Add Admin users who can do all.
- ~~implement `read-only` mode where sites cannot be added/edited/deleted, only
  allow to catch data for existing sites. This would be helpful to lockdown a
  single-site service after setting up your site.~~ [`Implemented as
  'lockdown'`]
- add test for empty form data, don't send email if so.
- version the API endpoints for future-proofing.
- add an 'echo' form_id that will simply echo the results back to you (for
  testing)
- implement spam protection. Can use `Botpoison`, `reCAPTCHA`, `Akismet` etc
- optionally send the submitted data back to the redirect URL so it can be
  personalised.
- display a generic redirect page if one is not provided, with a link back to
  the original site. Add our branding üòÅ but allow minor customisation.
- integrate with Slack, Google Sheets, Discord, Whatsapp and more
- add Webhooks
